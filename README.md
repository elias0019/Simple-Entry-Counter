## Features

- Display the current count on the webpage.
- Reset the counter to zero.

## Description

The Simple Entry Counter project is a straightforward implementation of a counter that keeps track of the number of entries or clicks on a button. It provides a visually appealing interface that displays the current count to the user.

The main functionality of the project revolves around a button that serves as an entry point. Each time the button is clicked, the counter increments by one, and the updated count is immediately reflected on the webpage. The user can keep clicking the button to increase the count further.

In addition to the counter, the project also includes a reset feature. By refreshing the webpage, the counter is reset to zero, allowing the user to start counting from scratch. This feature provides flexibility and convenience for users who want to reset the count at any point.

The project is built using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is responsible for creating the structure and content of the webpage, while CSS is used to style and enhance the visual appearance of the counter and button. JavaScript handles the dynamic functionality, including incrementing the count and updating the webpage in real-time.

The Simple Entry Counter project is an excellent starting point for learning and practicing basic web development concepts. It demonstrates the usage of event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic interactivity.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow the instructions provided in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

## Customization

The Simple Entry Counter project can be easily customized to meet your specific requirements and preferences. Here are a few ideas for customization:

- Change the visual appearance of the counter and button by modifying the CSS styles.
- Add additional functionality, such as a decrement button or a timer that resets the count after a certain period of time.
- Implement a persistent storage solution, such as a backend server or a client-side storage method, to save and retrieve the count across sessions.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different customizations to make the project your own.
